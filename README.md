## Hi!
I'm just another coder...you can leave now...
Still staying? May as well show you around...
## Programming
I code in Lua (mostly for Roblox, but that's a story for another time), Python and (a bit of) JavaScript. Want to know what I've made?
# Python - Groupblox
I have a Discord bot that's meant to be centered around Roblox, but just ends up being a general moderation bot half of the time. It's mostly a private bot, which is why I can tailor it to servers, but if you want to check it out anyway, that's available [here.](https://discord.gg/4eX56Jp)
# Lua - Roblox
As said, I mostly code in Lua for Roblox. I do some scripting, mostly for LeMonde, FlyBristol and airBristol. If you don't know what any of those are, you should really look up the Roblox aviation industry.

## Other Stuff
Well, I don't really have anything else to put here. Maybe this will get filled in later. Bye!
