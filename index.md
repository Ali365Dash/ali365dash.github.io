Hi! I'm just another coder. Of course, if you're reading this, I imagine you want to know a bit more than that.
# Programming
I code in Lua (mostly for Roblox, but that's a story for another time), Python and (a bit of) JavaScript. Want to know what I've made?
## Python - Groupblox
I have a Discord bot that's meant to be centered around Roblox, but just ends up being a general moderation bot half of the time. It's mostly a private bot, which is why I can tailor it to servers, but if you want to check it out anyway, that's available [here.](https://discord.gg/4eX56Jp)
## Lua - Roblox
As said, I mostly code in Lua for Roblox. I do some scripting, mostly for [LeMonde](https://www.roblox.com/My/Groups.aspx?gid=1156950), [FlyBristol](https://www.roblox.com/My/Groups.aspx?gid=2720616) and [Aviron](https://www.roblox.com/My/Groups.aspx?gid=3924384). If you don't know what any of those are, you should really look up the Roblox aviation industry.

# Other Stuff
If you want to keep up with what I'm doing, you can [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ali365dash) or...welp, I don't really have anything else to give you.
